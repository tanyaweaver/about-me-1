<h2>About Me</h2>
<br>
<h3>Past</h3>
<p>Raised in eastern Washington State, surrounded by wheat fields, hop fields, wineries,
  and a little radiation, Sean Champagne spent the first ten years of his life living
  in Cincinatti and bouncing around the entire eastern seaboard.  His mother is from
  a tiny village in Vermont and his father is from south of the Mason-Dixon line in
  Alabama, and both parents dragged him to and fro everywhere east of the Mississippi River
  before moving westbound to Washington State, where both his parents worked in nuclear
  at the Hanford Nuclear Site.  Sean has been to 49 states, all but Alaska, and he
  can assure everyone New England is filthy and the south is poverty-stricken and
  super depressing.  He has only been through the Midwest a couple times, while
  travelling from Washington State back to Ohio or vice versa, and each Midwestern
  state rightfully has earned the title 'flyover states'.  His paternal lineage
  links back to the Champagne-region of northern France, and his great-grandfather emigrated
  to Louisiana during the Spanish-American war (in which more French soldiers fought than
  Spanish soliders).  So yes, Champagne is his birth name.

<h3>Present</h3> <br>
<p>Sean has lived in Seattle, Washington, since 2010 and has lived on Queen Anne
  Hill since 2011 with his two dachshunds, Hansel and Wimbledon.  In addition to
  his dachshunds, Sean is also married to a wonderful German-American named Bode.
  Sean and Bode have been together since January 2010, adopted their dachshunds
  in March 2010, moved to Seattle together in October 2010, bought their condo
  on Queen Anne Hill in October 2011, and eloped in Stockholm, Sweden, in January 2014.
  They spend as much time as possible outdoors and love coffee, chocolate, and travelling.
  Currently, Sean is on his way to becoming a master coder and is laser-focused on
  curating the appropriate skills necessary to land a job as a software developer
  in an establishted technology company in Seattle.

<h3>Future</h3><br>
<blockquote>"For time and the world do not stand still.
  Change is the law of life.  And those who look only to the past
  or the present are certain to miss the future."</blockquote>
  <cite>John F. Kennedy</cite><br>
<p>While the future is unknown, Sean is developing the appropriate skills
  to always have job security and tremendous success wherever he and Bode go in
  the world.  With the ability to work remotely or for many different employers,
  Sean and Bode will eventually leave their wonderful home in Seattle and move to
  Maui (Sean's dream) or San Francisco (Bode's career opportunities at his employer).
  Eventually, further down the line, if they think about settling down and procreating,
  they would most likely move to Germany to be close to Bode's German family.
  Bode has one cousin in Europe (in Germany), and he is really really really really smart
  and speaks 5 languages.  My future offspring need to be that smart, and it appears
  completely possible in Europe.  Until they are both ready to settle down and procreate,
  Sean will continue closing his eyes and smelling the Hawaiian air and feeling the
  sand between his toes.  Seriously Maui is the best except it has no night life,
  but that wouldn't prevent me from moving there and letting my dachshunds chase geckos.
  Seriously, how great would that be?!
